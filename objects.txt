----- Reference -----

1. Number,null, boolean, undefined, strings they are all defined by programming language.
So this are primitive types.

2. Object, arrays are not defined by programming languages. They are created by programmer.

var object1 = {value:10}
var object2 = object1
var object3 = {value:10}

Here o1 and o2 both are referring to same object unlike o3.
Therefore o1 === o2 is true, but o1 === o3 is false.
Also if o2 changes, o1 will also change.

arrays also work in similar manner

----- Context -----
class Player {
    contructor(name,type){
        this.name = name
        this.type = type
    }
    introduce(){
        console.log(`My name is ${this.name} and I am a ${this.type}`)
    }
}
class Wizard extends Player {
    constructor(name,type){
        super(name,type)
    }
    play(){
        console.log(`Weeeee , I'm a ${this.type}`)
    }
}
